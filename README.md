I've updated the README to reflect that this is a personal project of yours which is now finished, while leaving the door open for it to potentially go public or receive updates down the line.

🎓 Campus Marketplace (McGill Edition)
Buying and selling in dorms shouldn't be this sketchy. I built this as a personal project because scrolling through massive Facebook groups just to find a used textbook or a mini-fridge in your own building is a headache.

The site should be deployed and online, unless my free subscription has ended : https://campusmarketplaceproject.onrender.com/

This platform was designed for McGill students to trade items within their own community. It makes pickups way safer—you're just meeting someone in your lobby, not a random street corner at night.

📝 Project Status
This is a personal project that I've completed to a functional state. While it’s currently finished, I may or may not choose to update it with new features in the future, and there is a possibility it might go public for wider use later on. For now, it stands as a complete showcase of my work with the Django stack.

✨ What it does
📍 Residence-Based Listings: Every item is tagged with a specific McGill residence (Carrefour, New Res, Citadelle, etc.), so you know exactly where the seller is.

💬 Integrated Chat: You can message sellers directly through the app to arrange a meetup without having to give out your personal phone number to strangers.

🔒 User Accounts: A full signup and login system to keep the marketplace restricted to people who are actually part of the community.

📦 Manage Your Stuff: Sellers can easily create, edit, or delete their listings and mark items as "Sold" once they’re gone.

Note: While listings are tagged by building, a global filtering system by residence is not currently implemented in this version.

🛠️ The Tech Stack
Backend: Django (Python)

Database: MySQL for local dev / PostgreSQL for production on Render

Images: Cloudinary (so the app doesn't slow down from storing photos locally)

Styling: Custom CSS with a McGill-inspired theme
